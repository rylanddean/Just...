# Reader Themes

**Tier:** Free  
**Effort:** M  
**Status:** Backlog

A settings panel where users choose from 6 carefully designed reading themes. Each theme changes the WKWebView CSS (background, text, accent colour), the SwiftUI reader chrome (Done button, progress bar, countdown ring, voice button), and the Reflect window (save button, cursor tint). Outside the reader, the app stays on its signature dark brown palette.

## Why

Reading in the same environment every day builds a ritual. Custom themes let users make that environment personally theirs — a small act of ownership that increases commitment to the habit. Offering 6 well-considered presets (not a raw colour picker) keeps the product opinionated while delivering real personalisation.

## Themes

| Name | Background | Text | Accent | Mood |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Ember** (default) | `#0C0A08` | `#C8B898` | `#E8A83E` | Warm amber. The current default. |
| **Slate** | `#0D1117` | `#C9D1D9` | `#58A6FF` | Cool blue. For tech-focused readers. |
| **Dusk** | `#1A1020` | `#D4C8E0` | `#C084FC` | Deep violet. Calm evening reading. |
| **Sage** | `#0F1612` | `#C8D8C0` | `#6FBF73` | Dark forest green. Easy on the eyes. |
| **Sepia** | `#F4ECD8` | `#3D2B1F` | `#8B4513` | Classic warm light mode. Bookish. |
| **Paper** | `#FAFAF8` | `#1A1A1A` | `#E05C2A` | Clean light mode. Newspaper-crisp. |

All six themes pass WCAG AA contrast for their body text / background pairs. Sepia and Paper are light-mode themes — they flip the WKWebView and SwiftUI backgrounds to light; the tab bar and nav chrome adapt accordingly.

## Experience

**Access:** Settings → Reader → Theme.  
**Preview:** Each theme tile shows a 3-line live text preview — users see exactly how articles will look before selecting.  
**Default state:** Ember is the default. All themes are available to all users.  
**Instant apply:** No restart required. The WKWebView re-injects CSS immediately on selection.

## Technical Approach

- Add a `ReaderTheme` enum with 6 cases. Each case provides `bg`, `text`, `accent` hex values as static properties.  
- Persist the selected theme in `UserDefaults` (not SwiftData — it is a preference, not data).  
- `ContentFetcher.readerCSS` becomes `readerCSS(for theme: ReaderTheme)` — interpolates the three CSS variables.  
- `AppTheme` gains `currentReaderTheme: ReaderTheme` backed by `UserDefaults`.  
- All reader views already use `AppTheme.readerAccent` — switching the theme propagates automatically.  
- For light themes (Sepia, Paper), inject `color-scheme: light` into the WKWebView and pass the light background to SwiftUI via the theme token.  
- Add a `SettingsView` if it doesn't yet exist; Reader Themes is its first section.
